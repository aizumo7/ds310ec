# DS310 AltGraph Extra Credit Project - Fall 2023
DS310 Extra Credit Repo.

This is the repo that will contain the files attributed to the DS310 Extra Credit Project on AltGraph for the Fall 2023 semester.

The 'altgraph_data_app application properties' folder contains the 'application.properties' file for altgraph_data_app with the environment variables for the Redis Cache and CosmosDB that our group configured for the project. Once cloning the original AltGraph repo, navigate to (azure-cosmosdb-altgraph > java > altgraph_data_app > src > main > resources) and replace the original 'application.properties' file with this one.

The 'altgraph_web_app application properties' folder contains the 'application.properties' file for altgraph_web_app with the environment variables for the Redis Cache and CosmosDB that our group configured for the project. Once cloning the original AltGraph repo, navigate to (azure-cosmosdb-altgraph > java > altgraph_web_app > src > main > resources) and replace the original 'application.properties' file with this one.
